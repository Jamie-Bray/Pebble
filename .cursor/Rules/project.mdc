# Cursor Project Rules for "Before You Go"

## ðŸ§± Architecture
- Use Flutter + Dart.
- Use Provider or Riverpod for state management.
- Use Hive for local data storage.
- Use Modular widgets (e.g., TaskCard, RoutineCard).
- Structure app with screens, widgets, models, and services folders.

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX
- Support both light and dark themes (use ThemeMode.system).
- Use Material 3 design guidelines.
- Bottom sheets should be used for editing routines and tasks.
- Routine player should be full-screen with progress tracking.
- All text must use UK English spelling.

## ðŸ“¸ Media Handling
- Use `image_picker` for photo capture.
- Use `path_provider` for storing images locally.
- Tasks can include optional photo confirmation.

## ðŸ§ª Testing
- Generate tests for each model and major widget.
- Use test-driven prompts when building new logic or UI.
- All new code must pass `flutter analyze` and basic widget tests.

## ðŸ“„ PRD Alignment
- Reference PRD located at /docs/BeforeYouGo_PRD_v1.md.
- Ensure all features align with PRD structure and priority.

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Notes
- No Firebase or sync in MVP; local-only.
- Accessibility and reassurance for neurodiverse users is a key priority.
- Minimize visual clutter and favor calm design (soft colors, minimal distractions).
